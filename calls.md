# Call for Participation

The workshop is slated to happen in Fall 2024. Our primary goal is to form a SEAS community around LLMs and foster potential collaboration. The theme of the workshop comprises (1) LLM technologies and (2) their broad applications in science/engineering research and education. The workshop is set to engage all SEAS departments as well as other schools in UVA. Participation is encouraged for everyone who is interested in LLM-related topics, such as our graduate and undergraduate students, postdoc researchers, and faculty. 

For more information, please refer to the [workshop website](https://uvanlp.org/llm-workshop-2024/) for the latest agenda.


## 1. Topics

This workshop has a broad technical program. All topics related to LLM in science and engineering will be encouraged. Topics are considered but not limited to 

1. Creation of LLMs, e.g., pre-training, finetuning, alignment, data acquisition and preparation;
2. LLM deployment, e.g., efficiency, security, trustworthiness, safety, and privacy;
3. LLM domain-specific applications, e.g., science, engineering, medicine, law, and health;
4. LLM user experience, e.g., choice of models, service, data, frameworks, or workflow;
5. LLMs in education and for education;
6. Ethical issues in LLMs in scientific and engineering applications, e.g., bias and fairness.


## 2. Invitations to Participate

All students, postdocs, and faculty are invited to participate in this workshop in the following ways.

- Presenting a related project or an opinion on LLM, and 
- Contributing topics and ideas for brainstorming discussion.

Please refer to the following for more information. 

### 2.1 Workshop Presentations

If you are interested in presenting your work and opinions in this workshop, please submit a brief description following the [ICLR template](https://github.com/ICLR/Master-Template). Typically, each submission should be one page (approximately, 200 words) and, at most, two pages. 

All _accepted_ submissions will be presented in the poster sessions, and some of the presentations will also be highlighted in lightning talks (2 -- 5 minutes). 

All submissions should be uploaded via the [LLM workshop submission page](https://openreview.net/group?id=virginia.edu/UVA/2024/LLM_Workshop) on OpenReview. 

The submission deadline is **October 1, 2024, 11:59 PM**.


### 2.2 Topics and Ideas for Discussion

In the panel discussion of this workshop, we would like to cover some open questions that interest you and the broader audience. We are looking for questions that we may not have an answer to at this moment, but an open discussion will benefit all of us. Here are some example questions, 

- _How can LLMs be efficiently trained or finetuned with UVAâ€™s computing infrastructure?_
- _How can LLMs be integrated into engineering education to enhance the learning experience and support personalized learning?_

But we are more than happy to hear your thoughts. Please share your questions (up to three) for our panel discussion using this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/agpvaT5x27KVoV7M8). 

The submission deadline is **October 1, 2024**.
