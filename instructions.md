- We will have the poster easels and boards setup and ready to use before the workshop starts. When you arrive, feel free to pick en available one, and get your poster ready. 
- Your poster will be there for the whole workshop, which will give the partcipanents more time to get familiar of your work. 

For CS students, you may use the poster printing service by following instructions on [this page](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/computing/doku.php?id=poster_printing).

## Lightning Talks

- When: There will be two sessions. Please find your assigned session and order below. 
- Length: each talk **three** minutes.
- Slides:
  - Must be a single PDF file. File name: "{day1 &#124; day2}_order_LastName.pdf". Examples: day1_02_smith.pdf, day2_13_Ali.pdf.
  - Before __Thursday Oct. 17, 11:59 PM__, upload the file via [this link](https://virginia.box.com/s/wt7s9uzftlan7uqf92ik4v7nvk7zqnfp) or send an email with the PDF file to _LLM_Wor.x9m3w41rnmy6cwco@u.box.com_
  - Slide contents: you may reuse/re-organize your poster content (if there's one). Or create anew. 
- You do NOT have to copy your slides to the presenting PC. Session chairs will load everyone's slides to the presenting PC ahead of time. 
- Before your session, see your session chair (see below) and introduce yourself.
- ðŸ¥‡ Awards. All workshop participants are invited: use links below to vote for your favorite talks. Out of the two sessions, the talks receiving the most votes will receive the Audience's Choice Awards, which the organizers will hand out at the end of the workshop.
- Have fun!
