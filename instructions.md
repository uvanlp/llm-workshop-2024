## Poster Presentation


- Poster size:  
- Two poster sessions
- 12:00 PM - 1:30 PM
- Get your poster ready, on the first day before 12:00 PM, and leave it there even after the poster session


Your poster will be there for the whole workshop, which will give the partcipanents more time to get familiar of your work. Please pick your poster up before at the end of the workshop on the second day (around October 20, 4:45 PM). 

For CS students, you may use the poster printing service by following instructions on this page.

## Lightning Talk

- When: There will be two sessions. Please find your assigned session and order below. 
- Length: each talk **three** minutes.
- Slides:
  - Must be a single PDF file. File name: "{day1 &#124; day2}_order_LastName.pdf". Examples: day1_02_smith.pdf, day2_13_Ali.pdf.
  - Before __Thursday Oct. 17, 11:59 PM__, upload the file via [this link](https://virginia.box.com/s/wt7s9uzftlan7uqf92ik4v7nvk7zqnfp) 
  - Slide contents: you may reuse/re-organize your poster content (if there's one). Or create anew. 
- You do NOT have to bring your slides to the workshop. Session chairs will load everyone's slides to the presenting PC ahead of time. 
- Before your session, see your session chair (see below) and introduce yourself.
- Have fun!
